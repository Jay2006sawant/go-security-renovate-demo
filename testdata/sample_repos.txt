# Smaller test repositories (faster to clone)

https://github.com/golang/tools
https://github.com/golang/crypto

# Note: These repositories are used for demonstration purposes only
# The tool will analyze their structure while using the vulnerable go-git library
# This demonstrates how security vulnerabilities can affect real operations
